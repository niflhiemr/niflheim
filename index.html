<h2>ABOUT HTE GAME</h2>
<p>
Plague Inc: The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction based on the smash hit video game Plague Inc. with over 85 million players. Each player is a deadly disease, evolving unique symptoms to customise their pathogen as they compete against each other to infect cities across the globe and be the first to wipe out humanity!
</p>

<h3>INFECT THE WORLD</h3>
<p>
The game is easy to learn, fast to set up and the intuitive game mechanics linked to the realistic theme help everyone get stuck into the game straight away. Experienced players will love the strategic depth and they can also enjoy the new Virus expansion which comes with unique special abilities and tactical options (included in the box for free). Watch out for Mutations!
</p>

<h3>EVOLVE AND SPREAD</h3>
<p>
Beginning with Patient Zero, you spread your infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points and preventing other players from becoming dominant. Initially, your pathogen is weak and unspecialised, so you will need to add new symptoms to make it stronger. Choose carefully and plan ahead in order to react to an ever-changing world.
</p>

<h3>A PLAGUE FOR EVERYONE</h3>
<p>As countries start to fall, you might try to eradicate a dominant player by bombing their diseased cities, or hold the Olympics to cause huge numbers of infected people to travel to a healthy continent.</p>
<p>We’re happy to guarantee that each box of Plague Inc: The Board Game will contain four deadly pathogens that are not classified by the CDC. They may cause sneezing, coughing, cannibalism, total organ failure and more. Please wash your hands after playing!</p>
